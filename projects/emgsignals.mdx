## Introduction

Electromyography (EMG) signals are electrical signals generated by muscle cells when they are electrically or neurologically activated. These signals are crucial for understanding muscle function and are widely used in prosthesis control. However, EMG signals are notoriously noisy and difficult to acquire accurately. Conventional techniques for processing these signals involve amplification and filtering through analog circuits, which often result in system instability.

## Frequency Range of EMG Signals

Surface EMG signals lie in the frequency range of 6Hz to 600Hz, with the dominant range being between 20Hz to 150Hz. This wide frequency range presents a challenge for effective signal processing, as it requires precise amplification and filtering to isolate useful data from noise.

## Project Aim

The project aimed to analyze EMG signals effectively over their complete frequency range. To address the issues associated with conventional techniques, an easy, effective, and reliable signal processing technique was designed. This approach involves performing spectrum analysis to convert the time domain signals into the frequency domain, which provides detailed data about the signal set.

## Methodology

### Signal Processing Technique

The signal processing technique was implemented on an Arduino Uno board. This approach eliminates the need for analog amplifiers and filtering circuits, which are prone to stability issues. By performing all processing tasks such as amplification, filtering, and thresholding digitally on the Arduino board, a more stable and reliable system was achieved.

### Spectrum Analysis

The conversion of time domain signals to the frequency domain allows for a more detailed analysis of the EMG signals. This process involves breaking down the signal into its constituent frequencies, which helps in identifying and isolating useful data from noise.

## Psychophysiological Approach to Rehabilitation

The main aim is to use the detailed data obtained from spectrum analysis for an alternative methodology in rehabilitation, specifically for prosthesis control. This psychophysiological approach to rehabilitation can reduce the cost of myoelectric arms and increase their efficiency. By allowing users to gain control over their muscle sets in a less stressful environment, this method enhances the overall rehabilitation process.

## Practical Application

To demonstrate the viability of this approach, DSP-processed EMG signals were used to play an online game. This practical application shows how the technique can be used in real-world rehabilitation scenarios, providing a fun and engaging way for users to train and improve their muscle control.

## Conclusion

This innovative signal processing technique offers a stable and reliable solution for analyzing EMG signals. By leveraging spectrum analysis and digital processing on an Arduino Uno board, a cost-effective and efficient method for prosthesis control has been developed. This psychophysiological approach to rehabilitation has the potential to significantly benefit amputees by providing a less stressful and more effective training environment.
